# Getting data from NodeRed to Homeassistant

## Prerequisite
So their is a couple of things you must have setup before this will make any sense.

### HomeAssistant OS 
If you are running homeassistant os you can install NodeRed from the add-on store [as described here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-community-add-on-node-red/55023)

### Else you need to setup the connection manually between HA and NR
I will not go into detail on how to that in this post, their are a lot of excellent guides that show how to do that.
